      <blockquote class="block-quote"><span class="text-span-3">&quot;</span><em>We worked with Dale in his capacity as GM of a HVAC client where we found that he was able to leverage both his simPRO &amp; business experience to quickly assess gaps and areas of opportunities for them.  Dale’s work with coaching and mentoring people, streamlining of systems and improving sales ratios had a significant impact on the business.  Further, knowing that he had previously worked as a consultant and head of product for simPRO we found that Dale was able to bring his extensive experience and knowledge to implement and automate workflows between simPRO and Xero that resulted in better business reporting and process efficiencies for our client.</em><br><br><em>o Drue Schofield, Managing Principal 4Front</em></blockquote>
      <blockquote class="block-quote"><span class="text-span-3">&quot;</span><em>I sought Dale&#x27;s advice when restructuring my business and brining on new partners to assist with our growth strategy. His values-centred guidance challenged me to think about a business model that aligned with my core values, passion, strengths and goals. Dale&#x27;s positive calming personality made it easy to open up to and work with.<br><br>o Darren Melahic, CEO Brisbane Roller Doors</em></blockquote>
      <blockquote class="block-quote"><span class="text-span-3">&quot;</span><em>Dale has been an ongoing support for myself and my business for the last few years. He has an ability to listen to all parties, identify areas for growth and formulate a roadmap to guide us. I recently decided to expand my business and Dale provided valuable support, guidance and assisted with providing strategies to achieve my goals. I could not have committed along this journey without Dale&#x27;s knowledge and experience, and his technical capabilities around simPRO has been invaluable.</em><br><br>o John Griffin, CEO Amalgamated Building Services</blockquote>
      <blockquote class="block-quote"><span class="text-span-3">&quot;</span><em>Flexible, intuitive, responsive, caring. From our first session together, Dale helped me clarify my thoughts when I starting my own business and helped me identify what I needed to do to move forward. He helped me see the &#x27;light at the end of the tunnel&#x27; by breaking down the steps I needed to take into bite sized actions.<br><br>o Brad Abel, CEO SB Air</em></blockquote>
      <blockquote class="block-quote"><span class="text-span-3">&quot;</span><em>I thought I left it too late when I reached out to Dale for help when my business was failing. Not at all phased by my panic, he just smiled and calmly said. It will be ok together we will work through it. Dale&#x27;s approach and steadfast dedication was amazing. He treated my business as his own, instantly identifying opportunities for quick wins and he helped me bring on board new clients and two major projects which immediately resulted in the injection of well needed cashflow. Within a couple of weeks my business was pumping like it had never been before. Dale had implemented systems to streamline processes, trained and coached all my staff, re negotiated deals with suppliers and put strategies in place to secure further growth.</em><br><br>o Mark McRae, CEO CustomAir Industries</blockquote>
      <blockquote class="block-quote"><span class="text-span-3">&quot;</span>I have known Dale for some 20 years and have watched his career path develop and evolve. He is a diligent and dedicated person that strives to improve and grow the companies he has worked with.<br><br>o Andrew Melvelle, CEO Melvelle Equipment</blockquote>
      <blockquote class="block-quote"><span class="text-span-3">&quot;</span>Dale is an extremely effective leader of his time. He displays excellent organisational skills and communicates clearly and concisely with staff. He is always prepared to offer his time and assistance to ensure the sucess of the whole team.<br><br>o Rita Noon, Imaging Consulting</blockquote>
      <blockquote class="block-quote"><span class="text-span-3">&quot;</span>Dale is a diligent and creative person. Dale is organised, efficient, extremely competent, and has an excellent rapport with people of all ages. His communication skills, both written and verbal, are excellent. In particular, Dale&#x27;s presentation skill are extraordinary. One day I asked him to explain an important concept in Operations Management in front of my team. His explanation was crystal clear and succinct that increased understanding of other students. Furthermore, Dale is competent in project management and situation analysis. He is also a good team leader in any project. He advocates Deming&#x27;s management philosophy that is needed for any organisation to improve its overall performance. Dale&#x27;s people-oriented approach to any work always brings the greatest outcomes. Dale has deep understanding in the areas of Operations Management, Quality Management, and Organisational Change and Development. In summary, I highly recommend Dale for any position or endeavor that he may seek to pursue. He will be a valuable asset for any organisation.<br><br>o Kaoru Kobayashi, International Journal of Business Research and Management</blockquote>
